## 3.0.0

#### Added

- **`handle_out_of_bounds` now supports `Partial`.** Under the hood, everything is plotted as a path, or array of points. An example would be `[(1,1), (2,2), (100,100), (3,3), (4,4)]`. With `Warning`, if any of the points in the path are out of bounds, the whole path will be skipped. With `Error`, the whole program will crash. With the introduction of `Partial`, if a point is out of bounds, the remaining points will be plotted as separate paths. Continuing with the example, if `(100,100)` is out of bounds, this would result in two paths being plotted at `[(1,1), (2,2)]` and `[(3,3), (4,4)]`

#### Changed

- **Offsets are now calculated from the plotter's origin.** Before, if the Plotter's min was defined as (10,20) and the user attempted to plot something at (0,0) it would fail because it was outside the plotter's bounds. Now, when a point is plotted at (0,0), it'll be translated to (10,20) and plot successfully. 

#### Fixed 

- **Can now plot characters with dots such as `!` and `.`** This was a bug with the implementation of text and has now been resolved. 

## 2.0.3

#### Added
- Added proper support for 3D printers.
- Added experimental functionality for a CLI tool and photo preprocessing.
```

```

2023-12-10

#### Added
- GCO-93 Added option to not raise plotting device after plotting a path with `raise_plotter_head_after_path` param.
- Added test for `add_text`

#### Changed
- GCO-106 Refactored code to have smaller files.
- Refactored test boilerplate to be reusable. 

#### Fixed
- GCO-105 Improved performance around plotting individual points.
- GCO-104 Fixed bug where `preview` method would not show points.


## 1.1.1

2023-12-09

#### Fixed
- `Plotter.preview()` method failed to plot single points. This has been fixed.

## 1.1.0

2023-12-02

#### Added
- `include_comments` option to `Plotter`. When set to `True`, the plotter will include comments in the output.

#### Changed
- When a point in a path is outside of the plotting device's bounds, the plotter will now print a warning and skip the entire path.

## 1.0.0

2023-12-02

#### Added
- Initial versioning release
