# Convert a 3D printer to a 2D plotter

Lots of folks have converted their 3D printers to 2D plotters. A quick search on Google, with the name of the [plotting device](./terminology#plotting-device) and "2d plotter" will yield free models that can be printed on the 3d printer. 

If you find an adapter or make your own, [please share it here](https://github.com/TravisBumgarner/gcode2dplotterart/discussions/6).

**Available Adapters**

Note - The Ender 3 V3 SE and Creality Ender 5 systems I designed myself.

## Making your own adapter

Note - I recorded a 3 part series on Twitch where I designed and printed my own adapter. You can watch the videos  on YouTube here: [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=867jL2bwx9c&t=931s&ab_channel=TravistheMaker), [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-9eQTv8wtY&ab_channel=TravistheMaker), [Part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzO6jngdEAM&ab_channel=TravistheMaker).

This is what we're going to aim to make.

Here are the instructions on how I made my own adapter. 

![Measurements photo](/img/convert-3d-to-2d/measure.jpg)

First I looked at my 3D printer and tried to find a place where I could mount a 3D printed part. My Ender 5 had two screws that were well placed that I thought I could attach my part to. My design would involve unscrewing those two screws, aligning the holes on the 3D printed part with those screw holes, and then screw everything together.

It took me a few different tries and adjusting my measurements before I had a part that fit well. The first experiment made sure the screw holes were lined up correctly. The second experiment had a better placement for the screw holes. The third experiment made sure that everything fit nicely together. The fourth experiment tested the ability to grip a plotting device.

Eventually I figured everything out and was ready for plotting.
