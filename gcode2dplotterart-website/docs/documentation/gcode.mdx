# G-Code Overview

## What is G-Code


G-Code is the programming language of 2D plotters and 3D printers. It is a lower level programming language and therefore is typically difficult to understand. Below is a snippet of code to plot a rectangle. This library aims to abstract away these instructions so that more user friendly code, such as Python, can be used instead to generate G-Code. For more information on G

``` gcode
G21
F10000
M3 S0
G1 X0.000 Y-50.000 F10000
M3 S1000
G04 P0.25
G1 X0.000 Y0.000 F10000
G1 X50.000 Y0.000 F10000
G1 X50.000 Y-50.000 F10000
M3 S0
G04 P0.25
M2
```

## Library Instructions

Below are a collection of all the instructions used in this library. For a more thorough explanation, [RepRap](https://reprap.org/wiki/G-code) and [Marlin](https://marlinfw.org/meta/gcode/) are great (and dense) resources. 

The square braces indicate a variable that can be passed to the specific G-Code instructions. For example the instruction `G1 X[x] Y[y]` takes in variables `x` and `y`, which could result in a G-Code instruction looking like `G1 X10.0 Y5.0`.

### Comment

Add a comment with a line starting with `;`. This instruction is not read by the plotting device.

```gcode
;The following instruction lifts the pen up.
M3 S0
```

### F

Set the movement speed `f` of the plotting device with `F[f]`. Can also be attached to individual [G1](#g1) commands. 

```gcode
F10000
```

### G1

 Move the plotting device to the specified `x` and `y` and `z` coordinates at a speed of `f` with `G1 X[x] Y[y] Z[z] F[f]`. Not all of the coordinates are required. 

```gcode
G1 X0.000 Y0.000 F10000
G1 X50.000 F10000
G1 Z10 F10000
G1 X50.000 Y-50.000 F10000
```

### G4

Pause for a period of time `p` with `G4 P[p]`. This command is useful in combination with a move command. A pause after moving will give the plotting device a chance to stop any vibrating that might impact the plotting quality. 

```gcode
; Lower plotter head
M3 S1000
; Pause for 0.25 seconds
G4 P0.25
;Point: 59.84807753012208, -48.2635182233307
G1 X59.848 Y-48.264 F10000
```

```gcode
G20
```

### G21

Sets the units of measurements to `mm`.

```gcode
G21
```

### G28

Home the plotting device. Will return the plotter to X = 0, Y = 0 and if supported, Z = 0. Not all plotting devices support this command.

```gcode
G28
```

### M2 

Marks the end of the program execution.

```gcode
M2
```

### M3

For 2D plotters, used to raise and lower the plotter head. `M3 S0` will raise the print and `M3 S1000` will lower the plotter head.

```gcode
; Raise plotter head
M3 S0
; Move to first coordinate
G1 X0.000 Y0.000 F10000
; Lower the plotter head
M3 S1000
; Draw two lines
G1 X50.000 Y0.000 F10000
G1 X50.000 Y-50.000 F10000
; Raise the plotter head on a 2D plotter, A `G1` command with `Z` height would be used here for a 3D printer.
M3 S0
```
