Preface - numpy and cv2 are still a bit alien to me. The code here could be done better.
1. Take in an image.
2. Grayscale all of the pixels so that each pixel is represented by a number from 0 to 255.
3. Bucket the pixels such that
  - 0 -> A   becomes 0
  - A -> B   becomes 1
  - B -> C   becomes 2
  - C -> 255 becomes 3
4. Start with a random pixel in the image that hasn't been plotted.
5. Add this point to the path
6. Look to the neighboring pixels
  - If a neighboring pixel, order randomly chosen, is of the same color, add it to the path.
  - If the neighboring pixel hasn't been added to a path before, repeat step 6.
  - If the neighboring pixel has been added to a path before, repeat step 4.
  - If there are no neighboring pixels of the same color, repeat step 4.
7. Continue until all points of all colors are plotted.
Note
- Make sure that the combination of X_SCALE, Y_SCALE, and the resized image aren't too big for the plotter area.
