# 2023-11-15 Image Lines

## Description

Convert an image into a series of parallel lines where each line is one of N colors.

## Images

## Code

```python
from gcode2dplotterart import Plotter2D
import cv2
import numpy as np
from imutils import resize
from math import floor
from typing import List

"""
Preface - numpy and cv2 are still a bit alien to me. The code here could be done better.

1. Take in an image.
2. Grayscale all of the pixels so that each pixel is represented by a number from 0 to 255.
3. Bucket the pixels such that
  - 0 -> A   becomes 0
  - A -> B   becomes 1
  - B -> C   becomes 2
  - C -> 255 becomes 3
4. Start with the first row of pixels.
5. Add the first point to a new path and move to the next pixel.
6. If the current pixel is the same as the previous pixel, append the point to the path and repeat, otherwise,
    start a new path.
7. Continue until all points of all colors are plotted.

Note
- Make sure that the combination of X_SCALE, Y_SCALE, and the resized image aren't too big for the plotter area.
